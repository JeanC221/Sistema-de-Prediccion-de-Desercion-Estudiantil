##  Overview
This project is an analytical tool designed to identify students at risk of dropping out. Using Machine Learning, the system processes academic and socio-economic data to provide early intervention insights. 

**Awarded Academic Recognition** at Universidad del Norte for its technical execution and social impact.



##  Key Features
* **Data Preprocessing:** Robust cleaning and normalization of large datasets using **Pandas** and **NumPy**.
* **Predictive Modeling:** Implementation of classification algorithms (Scikit-Learn) to predict dropout probability.
* **Web Interface:** A functional API and dashboard built with **Flask** to visualize results.
* **Actionable Insights:** Generates reports to facilitate early intervention by educational counselors.

##  Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Data Analysis:** Pandas, NumPy
* **Machine Learning:** Scikit-Learn
* **Backend:** Flask
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebooks (for research) & Python Scripts (for production)
